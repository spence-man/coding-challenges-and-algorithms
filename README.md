# Code Challenges, Algorithms and Data Structures

This is an organization of the concepts I'm learning as I follow through the Udemy online course [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/), and practices exercises through [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

I included files in Ruby as well just for my own general reference. I'm interested in seeing how the implementations compare in Javascript vs. Ruby.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Worst complexity: n^2

Average complexity: n^2

Best complexity: n

Space complexity: 1

### Selection Sort

Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

Worst complexity: n^2

Average complexity: n^2

Best complexity: n^2

Space complexity: 1
